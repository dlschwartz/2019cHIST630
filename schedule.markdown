## 19 September
_**There will be no regular class meeting on September 19 as I will be traveling. Instead, you should work on the [GitHub Pages assignment](../pages).**_

#### _Ludi_
* GitHub Pages and Jekyll
	* Nate Barbettini, "Learning Static Site Building with Jekyll," _inLearning_, December 14, 
 2018, <https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-static-site-building-with-jekyll>{:target="_blank"}.
	* Amanda Visconti, "Building a Static Website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages," _The Programming Historian_ 
 5 (2016), <https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages>{:target="_blank"}.



_____
## 26 September

#### _Ludi_
* GitHub Pages and Jekyll
	* We will spend time in our class session looking at your GitHub Pages assignments, 
	trouble-shooting problems, and considering options for further development.
* Regular Expressions
	* Kevin Skoglund, "Learning Regular Expressions," _inLearning_, November 21, 
	2011, <https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-regular-expressions>{:target="_blank"}.  
		* Ideally you would do this course first. It offers a thorough introduction to RegEx. However, it's
 quite long. Feel free to skip the parts of section 10 that might not be relevant to your particular use of RegEx.
		* While there are many RegEx "cheat-sheets" available online, I would recommend that
 you make your own as you watch this course.
	* Doug Knox, "Understanding Regular Expressions," _The Programming Historian_ 2 
	(2013), <https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/understanding-regular-expressions>{:target="_blank"}.  
		* This lesson offers a nice example of one way to use RegEx for handling historical texts. 
		It is not as in-depth as the Linked In course above. If you find yourself really strapped for time, 
		you could get away with starting by doing this lesson and then choosing some relevant sections of the other 
		course to develop skills you think will be relevant to your work.

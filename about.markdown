### Expectations
You will note in the class schedule that every class meeting has a heading for
_Ludi_. This is a Latin word we can translate as "play things." I have
chosen this term because I want us all to think of class time as an opportunity
to experiment, collaborate, offer feedback, and troubleshoot difficulties. In short,
you should come to class expecting to _play around_ with the course material, topics,
and skills you will begin learning outside of class. This approach means there is a high
likelihood that sometimes things won't work, or at least that they won't work as intended.
We should all expect this kind of "failure." But failure can be productive. Let's
all come to class ready to play, have fun even, and learn as we go.
